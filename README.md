# HeavyBlocks_Rewrite

Project Name: Heavy Blocks
Developer: Steven Nguyen
Date: 10/22/2019

Description of Project:
Heavy Blocks will be an offline, 2D, single-player game- while both using and avoiding lethal falling “Heavy blocks” the user will control a stick character navigating through various levels. The project will be made/run from either “Processing” or as a windows application.
Essential Features:
	-A main screen with the buttons:
		-Play - will enter the user into the highest level world the user has access to.
		-Levels - will enter the user into a level selecting interface.
		-Controls - will enter the user into a keyboard control choosing interface.
	-At least two worlds of which a player can play.
		-The ability to move left, right, and jump, as well as the ability to win, and lose.
		(Explained further in WireFrame)
	-Various shape types, potentially Tetris like shapes to increase difficulty.
	-Different difficulties simulated by fall block speeds, shapes, win locations, etc
	-A precaution for the randomly generated falling “Heavy Blocks” to give the player
	a guaranteed path to winning.
Optional Features:
	-An animation between each screen (between main screen, Controls, and Levels).
Technology used:
	-This program will be run/created as either a “Processing” or a Windows program.
System requirements:
	-If using processing, must have the application processing to run.
	-If using windows program, must have windows 10 software.
User Classes:
	-Players’ user class is depicted in the WireFrame pg.1
Project Dependencies:
	-Processing software/libraries are consistent throughout the development of this project 
	or will not have major changes in current libraries within Processing.
